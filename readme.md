# CSS CHECKPOINT
Hello there, Abdelkader, this project got too big too quickly, I decided to use SASS instead of old plain CSS to make it easier for me, you can find the normal CSS file in ```
.\styles\css\index.css```

responsivenessw was not taken into consideration so it might look weird on smaller devices, the header is kind of responsive though.

And I didn't really code the JS part of the scroll up button, it was taken from W3School, but I understand some parts of it.

A live preview is on the top right corner. And yeah, that's it, hope you like it.
